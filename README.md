# Recipes Website The Odin Project

Set up your README.md file and write a brief introduction describing what the current project is and what skills you will have demonstrated once you have completed it. (You can also do this as a self-reflection at the end of the project, which is a good way to review that you have learned).

Second time I try to re-do this simple project after learning Advanced HTML & CSS course, Animation section. This project now use: npm, webpack, tailwindcss, babel, and gh-pages to host.
